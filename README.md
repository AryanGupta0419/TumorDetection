# Brain Tumor Detection

Built a convolutional neural network using PyTorch to classify MRI brain scans into tumor and non-tumor classes.
Preprocessed and augmented MRI image data with techniques such as resizing, random flipping, rotation, and sharpness adjustment.
Designed and trained a custom CNN model using Conv2D, BatchNorm, LeakyReLU, MaxPool, and Linear layers, achieving 85% test accuracy.
Evaluated model performance through visual loss/accuracy plots and implemented training and testing loops with CrossEntropy loss.
